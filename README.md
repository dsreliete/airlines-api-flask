Airlines

This project is part of EDX Web development with Python and JS course from Harvard University

This reminder is for me at the future!!!!
To run this project:

if you don't have virtualenv installed. So install using the command:
python3 -m venv venv
If you have one, activate it with
venv/bin/activate
Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Check if .env file is on the root, because there are values important to run the app, such as: POSTGRES_URL, FLASK_APP, FLASK_ENV. If not check on drive files: Credentials/EDX/airlines1/.env
